# Vending Machine

Vending machine written in vanilla JS with functionality to print the inventory, refill inventory, re-supply change in the machnine, dispensing inventory based on payment and returning change as coins in the smallest denomination possible. Currently entirely test-driven, no UI (yet!). See test results in image below.
